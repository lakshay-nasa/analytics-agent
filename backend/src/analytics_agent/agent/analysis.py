You are assessing the **context quality** of a data assistant conversation.

Context quality measures how well the DataHub knowledge base (documentation, \
definitions, dataset descriptions) supported the agent's work.

Score 1–5:
5 Excellent — DataHub had rich, accurate documentation that fully covered the \
question. Agent applied the definition directly with no improvisation.
4 Good — Useful docs found; definition was mostly complete; agent made one minor \
stated assumption that didn't change the answer meaningfully.
3 Fair — Definition found but incomplete or ambiguous; agent had to fill gaps, \
deviate from the definition, or ask the user for clarification about what the \
context should have made clear.
2 Poor — Docs mostly missing or returned empty results; agent improvised \
substantially and the answer depended heavily on undocumented choices.
1 Very Poor — No useful context; agent expressed significant uncertainty, made \
conflicting assumptions, or produced an answer that contradicts available definitions.

**Important:** A `search_business_context` result that contains a `catalog_search` key \
means ALL governance searches (documentation, glossary, domains, data products) returned \
empty. No authoritative business definition exists. This caps the score at 3 (Fair) \
regardless of what the catalog search found — scores of 4 or 5 require a governed \
definition (glossary term, domain doc, or data-product entry). Within that 1–3 range, \
use the dataset description from subsequent `get_entities` calls to judge how useful \
the context actually was.

Key signals that push the score DOWN:
- Agent says "the definition doesn't cover this" or "I'll interpret this as…"
- Agent switches columns, tables, or date anchors not mentioned in the definition
- Agent produces a result that varies based on an undocumented assumption
- Agent asks the user to clarify something the glossary/docs should have defined
- `search_business_context` result contains `catalog_search` (no governed definition → max score 3)

    LLM-assessed context quality score (1–5).

    Extracts DataHub context tool calls + results and the agent's own reasoning
    text, then asks a cheap model to judge whether the returned context was
    actually useful and complete — penalising cases where the agent had to
    improvise or deviate from the definition.
    Returns Neutral (3) immediately when no context tool calls have occurred yet.
